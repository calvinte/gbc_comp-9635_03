<p id="first">I'm currently a front-end web developer at a private college trying to become a back-end developer. I took the web design program and a few  photography courses at GBC before and thought I'd try the delevopment one. I've built websites before but with my limited understanding of JavaScript and what was happening on the sever side I felt like i wasn't doing the best work i could do. I'm excited to be taking this course because I'm eager to learn the skills that'll take me away from building wireframes and static websites to building complex and dynamic websites.</p>
